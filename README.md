# Sendlove API

This is a 'Skeleton' project for Swagger API using Mongodb.

The schema is a parts explosion comprised of two collections, *Things* and *Parts*. Except for user management, the entire site is powered by these two tables. Swagger.io API models are in the [swagger](swagger/) folder, and all the CRUD operations are in the two controllers [api/controllers/partController.js](api/controllers/partController.js) and [api/controllers/thingController.js](api/controllers/thingController.js).
